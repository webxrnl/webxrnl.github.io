Welcome at WebXR NL
WebXR NL is the first Dutch network for VR, AR and MR creators who want to bring and share their immersive experiences to the web.

We strive to improve and expand immersive webcontent and techniques in The Netherlands. Therefore we try to connect those who are interested or already have implemented webXR in any form.

The network is aimed at developers, content creators, organizations / businesses and vendors. But also if you are none of the above, your are more than welcome to join our meetups, events and other activities.

Following the global pandemic, we've adapted our approach to community engagement. We've not yet resumed in-person events, but we still maintain a strong online presence through the WebXR Discord. Join us for our monthly meetup in Mozilla Hubs every last Sunday of the month, alongside our other activities. Make sure you join the Discord to stay up to date with all our events, both virtual and in-person!
